# Connect Recorder Response Extractor
# ================================================================
#
# DESCRIPTION:
#   This script extracts the raw body of a specific response from a JSON file
#   containing event recordings. It allows you to specify which response to
#   extract by its index in the responses array.
#
# USAGE:
#   ./recorder-extractor <file_path> [response_index]
#
# ARGUMENTS:
#   file_path       - Path to the JSON file containing event recordings
#   response_index  - (Optional) Index of the response to extract from the responses array
#                     Can be positive (0, 1, 2, etc.) or negative (-1 for last item)
#                     Default: -1 (last response)
#
# EXAMPLES:
#   ./recorder-extractor event-recording.json       # Extract the last response
#   ./recorder-extractor event-recording.json 0     # Extract the first response
#   ./recorder-extractor event-recording.json -2    # Extract the second-to-last response
#
# OUTPUT:
#   The script outputs the formatted contents of the specified response's rawBody field.
#
# NOTES:
#   - Requires jq to be installed on your system
#   - The script expects JSON in a specific format with readConnectRecording.responses[].rawBody
# ================================================================

# Check if correct number of arguments is provided
if [ "$#" -lt 1 ] || [ "$#" -gt 2 ]; then
    echo "Usage: $0 <file_path> [response_index]"
    echo "Example: $0 my-file.json -1"
    exit 1
fi

# Assign arguments to variables
FILE_PATH=$1
# Default to last element if no index is provided
RESPONSE_INDEX=${2:--1}

# Execute the jq command with the provided arguments
cat $FILE_PATH | jq ".readConnectRecording.responses[$RESPONSE_INDEX].rawBody|fromjson"

echo "Processed file: $FILE_PATH, response index: $RESPONSE_INDEX"
